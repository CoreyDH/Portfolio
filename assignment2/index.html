            <p>
              Corey is an aspiring web developer that has been in the web design and support fields professionally since 2012.
            </p><br />
            <p>
              His humble beginnings started all the way back in 1998 when he was a part of websites such as Galaxy Games Network and Diablo 2 Frequency.  While not widely known, it did spur his interests in web development as a possible career choice.  However due to unclear goals at the time, it would not come until much later in life that he realized his true passion was there all along.
            </p><br />
            <p>
              Striving to get into his renewed career interest as soon as possible, he joined a coding bootcamp hoping to accelerate his learning and some day land that dream job.  His story is not yet finished, and one day that dream will be realized.
